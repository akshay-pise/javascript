    there  are 6 type
        -Arithmatic operater
        -Comparison  operater
        -logical operater
        -Assignment operators
        -Ternary operater / Conditional Operators

    (1). Arithmaatic operater :-
                -the arithmatic operater is perform between oprater and oprands
            -there are various arithmatic operater like(+, -, *, /, %, ++, --).
    (2). Comparison  operater :-
                -the comparison operater is perform between oprater and oprands

    (3). logical operater :-

    (4). Assignment operators :-
                 -there are various assignment operators like(=,+=,-=,/=,%=).
    (5). ternary operater /Conditional Operators:-
                -the ternary operater is  like if condition . fistly check the value and excute 
                syntax. <condition> ? first code : second code;
                eg. var a=10, b=20;
                    a<b ? a is greeter : b is greeter.
